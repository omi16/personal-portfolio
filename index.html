            <p>Hello!! This is Salma Ferdous Omi from a southwestern city of Bangladesh, currently living in
                Bremen,Germany.
                I am
                doing my master's studies in Digital Media (Media Informatics) at the University of Bremen, Germany. I
                enjoy
                SOLID programming with an emphasis in understanding the basic concepts and theories behind algorithms,
                software and software tools. Hence I love to spend my leisure hours by painting, listening to music,
                reading
                books, but most of all I love travelling.</p>
